## CPRAâ€“Counterparty-Risk-Assessment-System-with-Wallet-Ranking (<a href="https://frontend-dot-dssdigitalwalletrank.uc.r.appspot.com/">DEPLOYED CPRA</a>)

<ul>
  <li>Developed CPRA (Counterparty Risk Assessment) system to assess and visualize risk levels associated with digital wallets using transaction history, counterparty reputation, and temporal risk propagation.</li>
  <li>Designed an interactive frontend using React.js to allow users to configure wallet networks, simulate transactions, and visualize dynamic risk scores.</li>
  <li>Built a network graph visualization to represent wallet connections and real-time risk levels using D3.js.</li>
  <li>Enabled user interaction features such as clickable wallet nodes, historical risk score graphs, and detailed transaction logs for each wallet.</li>
  <li>Implemented simulation controls to adjust algorithm parameters including damping factor, iteration count, and high-risk thresholds.</li>
  <li>Created two simulation modes: Locked Risk (no decay) and Free Risk (time-based decay), to model different risk behaviors over time.</li>
  <li>Developed backend logic using Node.js or Python to implement a PageRank-inspired algorithm for dynamic wallet risk scoring.</li>
  <li>Simulated transaction flows between wallets and updated balances and risk scores in real-time based on network interactions.</li>
  <li>Used MongoDB to store wallet configurations, transaction history, and risk score logs for scalable and efficient querying.</li>
  <li>Ensured seamless communication between frontend and backend using RESTful APIs or WebSocket protocols.</li>
  <li>Applied concepts from financial analytics, network theory, and blockchain systems to model realistic risk propagation scenarios.</li>
  <li>Documented architecture, API endpoints, and simulation logic for maintainability and future expansion.</li>
</ul>
